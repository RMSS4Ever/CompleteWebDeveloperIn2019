        This is where, at least I think where, I'm going to be starting my course
        "The Complete Web Developer In 2019: Zero to Mastery" from Udemy.

        Cloned repository to my desktop and now seeing about making changes and
        adding it to the repository.

      of the stuff I need to keep notes on below.
